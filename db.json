Visenya Targaryen, on her dragon Vhagar, burned the Arryn fleet in response. Since both fleets were destroyed, the battle was considered a tactical draw, but a strategic defeat for the Targaryens as they were unable to take Gulltown.

When Sharra returned to the Eyrie she found her son sitting on Visenya's lap asking if he could ride the dragon with her.

Maegor was scornful of Alton's offer, but remembering his words he eventually chose women of proven fertility when he wed three new brides in 47 AC.[3]",

Its walls, keep, and towers were made of white stone quarried in the Vale of Arryn, and its floors and pillars were crafted from white marble veined with gold. The rafters were carved from the trunks of weirwoods.[1]",

On account of his reputation as being one of the deadliest knights in the Seven Kingdoms in his day.[8]",
                            "Lord Qarl Corbray declared for Prince Aegon the Uncrowned in a conflict against his uncle, King Maegor I Targaryen. During the campaign, Aegon found himself surrounded by three armies loyal to Maegor. Lord Corbray advised Aegon to attack his foes separately before they could join their forces, but Aegon refused and continued his march towards King's Landing. Ultimately, the armies faced each other near the Gods Eye. When Aegon and his dragon, Quicksilver, were killed by Maegor atop Balerion, the Battle Beneath the Gods Eye was lost for Aegon's supporters. Lord Qarl was able to kill Ser Davos Darklyn of the Kingsguard with Lady Forlorn, however, and he survived the battle. The Corbrays were pardoned by King Maegor, but they were stripped of some lands and titles and were forced to give up hostages.[8]",
                            "When Prince Jaehaerys Targaryen took the Iron Throne in 48 AC after Maegor's death, he arrested the Commander of the City Watch and named Qarl in his stead.[9] The following year, Qarl was one of the lords who represented of the Vale of Arryn at the Golden Wedding.[9]",
                            "Jaehaerys's mother and regent, Queen Alyssa Velaryon, wanted to reward the lords who had declared for Aegon the Uncrowned by choosing a bride for Jaehaerys amongst their kin. The Corbrays were one of the Houses considered by Alyssa.[9] This idea never came to fruition, however, but Qarl remained a staunch supporter of the Queen Regent. When Lord Rogar Baratheon refused his dismissal by Alyssa from the office of Hand of the King, Qarl drew Lady Forlorn, prompting Rogar to concede. Qarl also hid Princess Aerea Targaryen under Alyssa's orders to keep Rogar's brother, Ser Ronnal Baratheon, from taking her to Storm's End with the departing Baratheon household.[10] In 58 AC, Lord Qarl advised Jaehaerys against naming Barth his new Hand due to the septon's humble origin. The following year, the deaths of Qarl and many his gold cloaks from the Shivers provoked a short period of chaos in the streets of King's Landing. Qarl was eventually replaced at the head of the City Watch by Ser Robert Redwyne.[11]",
                            "During the Dance of the Dragons, the Corbrays followed their liege lord, Lady Jeyne Arryn, and supported Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and the blacks. Towards the end of the war, Lord Leowyn Corbray and his younger brother, Ser Corwyn Corbray, were entrusted by Jeyne to lead ten thousand men descending from the Vale towards King's Landing.[12] The Corbray brothers, along with Lady Jeyne and the Lads, took control of the city from Cregan Stark, Lord of Winterfell, but let him preside over the trials of those suspected of poisoning the late king, Aegon II Targaryen.[13]",
                            "Once the trials were dealt with and the war over, a council of regents was created to aid the young Aegon III Targaryen. Lord Leowyn was named Protector of the Realm, but Aegon's Hand, Ser Tyland Lannister, quickly achieved an unspoken dominance over Leowyn, gathering more power to himself as time passed. When the matter of Aegon's succession was brought up to the council, Leowyn favored Aegon's half-sister, Princess Rhaena Targaryen, over her older wilder twin, Princess Baela Targaryen.[14] As the regents did not desire Baela to produce an heir with her husband, Lord Alyn Velaryon, they quickly married Rhaena off to the man she chose, Corwyn Corbray.[14]",
                            "Lord Leowyn died of the Winter Fever in 133 AC, alongside his mistress and several of his servants.[14] He was succeeded as Lord of Heart's Home by his son, Quenton Corbray.[N 1] The title of Protector of the Realm was passed on Lord Unwin Peake, Aegon's Hand after the death of Ser Tyland.[14]",
                            "The following year, Ser Corwyn was named a regent after Lord Manfryd Mooton died of age and illness.[15] The year 134 AC also marked the death of Lady Jeyne Arryn and the start of a war of succession in the Vale. Corwyn was dispatched to settle the matter, but he was killed by a crossbowman at Runestone when he came to confront Lord Gunthor Royce, who supported Ser Arnold Arryn instead of Jeyne's chosen heir, Ser Joffrey Arryn. Following the death of his uncle, Lord Quenton declared for Joffrey, who was eventually installed as Lord of the Eyrie. Lord Quenton came to King's Landing in 136 AC to attend the Great Council, in which new regents were chosen for Aegon III.[16]",

They dueled for nearly an hour, their Valyrian steel swords Blackfyre and Lady Forlorn clashing loudly. At last, Blackfyre struck Gwayne's helm and left him blind and bleeding. Daemon dismounted to tend to his foe and ordered Redtusk to carry Gwayne back to the maesters for healing, an action that afterwards some considered decisive, since it gave the Raven's Teeth enough time to find a good position to fire the arrows that killed Daemon.[17]",

In the ensuring battle, Lord Farman and his eldest son perished alongside Aegon the Uncrowned. Farman's second son Marq succeeded him as Lord of Fair Isle. The widowed Rhaena Targaryen fled from Maegor to Fair Isle, where Lord Marq granted her the hospitality of Faircastle.[6] When Rhaena was summoned to King's Landing by Maegor the Cruel in 47 AC, she went as she had grown fond of Lord Farman and even more than fond of his second son Androw, and ignoring Maegor's summon would bring the king with his dragon Balerion down on Fair Isle.[6]",

The marriage had been conducted without the Crown's leave, and angered many at court believing Rhaena had married below her station.[8] While Rhaena insisted she married Androw as he was kind to her, Lord Farman's maester Smike suggested that Rhaena had fallen in love with Androw's sister, Elissa. The marriage caused discord on Fair Isle, with some Fair Islanders fearing her dragon Dreamfyre, while court life at Faircastle became centered around Rhaena and her companions, earning them the resentment of Lord Farman's heir, Ser Franklyn. While Lord Marq was a happy host of Rhaena, he died choking on a fish bone in 50 AC and Franklyn succeeded him as Lord of Fair Isle. Franklyn was quick to dispel Rhaena and Androw from Fair Isle, and Elissa followed them despite his efforts to keep her at Faircastle.[2]",

With Rhaena's reluctant leave, Elissa set sail for Pentos, but not before stealing three dragon eggs.[9] Elissa would sell the eggs to the Sealord of Braavos and use the money to build a ship to sail the Sunset Sea.[10] Rhaena was enraged at the betrayal, arguing with Androw when she accused him of aiding his sister. Though never passionate, Rhaena's marriage with Androw continued to decline, reaching a low in 54 AC. He often found himself ignored and sidelined at court and by other nobles, with Rhaena even declaring \"The wrong Farman ran away.\" Furious at his own treatment, Androw poisoned Rhaena's companions with tears of Lys. When confronted by Rhaena, he committed suicide by leaping from a window.[9] When her daughter Aerea went missing, Rhaena searched for her on Fair Isle, where Rhaena threatened Lord Franklyn after a heated conversation, appalling King Jaehaerys and his lords alike. In his next progress, the king would omit visiting Fair Isle,[10] which he would not visit until 88 AC when Lord Franklyn had passed.[11]"

Lord Farman and his sons were ransomed back to Casterly Rock.[12][13] Lord Farman later perished in the Dance, as did two of his daughters. After the war, Greyjoy was instructed by the Crown to return Fair Isle to the Farmans, though the Red Kraken ignored the edicts.[14] Lord Alyn Velaryon was dispatched to recapture Fair Isle with the Velaryon fleet in 133 AC. While Velaryon was making his way west, the Red Kraken was murdered by a girl named Tess. Much of the Greyjoy fleet fled the island, and the Fair Isle smallfolk and remaining knights rebelled against the ironborn. Only Faircastle remained under ironborn control, until its garrison commanders quarreled over Lysa Farman, one of Dalton's salt wives. When Velaryon arrived, the ironborn had abandoned Fair Isle and it was restored to the Farmans. The Farmans were left to rebuild their fleets.[15]",

                    "Ser Jon Heddle, known as Long Jon, was a knight in the 1st century AC. When he was crippled and done with adventuring, he took over the old inn at the crossroads between the Kingsroad, the river road, and the high road. Jon took to ironworking as well, creating a sign for his inn in the shape of a three-headed dragon. The iron sign would clank in the wind and gave the inn its new name, the Clanking Dragon.[1]",
                    "Many years later in 196 AC, when Long Jon's son was an old man, the First Blackfyre Rebellion broke out. Lord Darry, then overlord of the inn's lands, was a famous Targaryen supporter. He saw the inn's black iron dragon sign and became angry because it resembled the coat of arms of the rebels, House Blackfyre; he cut it down, hacked it to pieces, and threw it into the river. Eventually one of the iron dragon's heads washed up on the Quiet Isle, red with rust.[1]",
                    "Some years later, a descendant of Long Jon, Ser Tommard Heddle, sought the hand of Lord Ambrose Butterwell's daughter, killing three of her other suitors. The two were married and Black Tom Heddle became a sword of House Butterwell's household and commander of the garrison at Whitewalls. In 212 AC, Lord Butterwell and Black Tom became involved with the Second Blackfyre Rebellion. When Black Tom attempted to capture or kill Egg, the disguised prince and squire to Ser Duncan the Tall, he was challenged and killed by Dunk. The rebellion was put down within the day.[2]",
                    "Over time, the Heddles' inn became known as the River Inn, where one could take a ferry across to Lord Harroway's Town and Whitewalls. However, the river moved and soon that name faded. Masha Heddle's grandfather was the innkeeper at the time the river moved, c.220 AC-230 AC.[1]",

The Hand of the King, Lord Tywin Lannister, assembled an army that could easily storm the town, but Lord Denys menaced that he would kill the king as soon as the attack started. Aerys was held prisoner in the Dun Fort for half a year with Tywin's army waiting outside Duskendale. The situation remained invariable until Ser Barristan Selmy of the Kingsguard entered the Dun Fort, slew Symon, and rescued the king. Having lost his hostage, Lord Denys had no other option then to surrender at once. He bent the knee and begged for mercy, but the king demanded his head and all his family's.[4]",

King Benedict I Justman extended his domains to Maidenpool and the Neck, while his son Benedict II acquired Duskendale, Rosby, and the mouth of the Blackwater Rush.[2]",
                    "The Justmans ruled for almost three hundred years, but King Bernarr II was the last of the line. Qhored Hoare, the King of the Iron Islands, murdered Bernarr's sons in the Guest Keep of Pyke, known afterward as the Bloody Keep.[3] Bernarr's campaign against the ironborn was hopeless, and the riverlands fell into anarchy for a century after the fall of the Justmans.[2]",
                    "After the Storm King Arlan III Durrandon conquered the riverlands, various pretenders unsuccessfully claimed to be river kings. One such was Lucifer Justman, although his lineage with the Justmans is unconfirmed.[2]"

When the conflict began in 42 AC, Prince Aegon Targaryen and his sister-wife, Princess Rhaena were in the middle of a royal progress through the westerlands, and were briefly trapped at Crakehall by Poor Fellows, until Lord Lyman offered the couple refuge at Casterly Rock. Lyman refused to surrender them to King Maegor I Targaryen, although he declined to support Aegon's claim militarily. A shrewd ruler, Lyman carefully weighed his actions and played both sides: when young Aegon the Uncrowned eventually raised a rebel army to march against his uncle Maegor, Lyman's bastard son Ser Tyler Hill led five hundred men from Lannisport to join his forces - thus allowing Lyman himself to plausibly deny that he had directly ordered a force of westermen to join the rebels. As it happened, Aegon was slain by Maegor in the Battle Beneath the Gods Eye in 43 AC, though Tyler Hill survived.[21]",

They could no longer face Maegor in open battle but resorted to ambush and harassing his forces. By late 45 AC, Joffrey ruled the hill country north of the Golden Tooth in all but name. Maegor also later sent the son of Jeyne Westerling to be Lyman's ward.[21]",

At the very end of the conflict in 48 AC, Maegor's nephew Jaehaerys I Targaryen declared against him, and after his brutal reign the Great Houses could finally stand him no longer. First the Velaryons declared for Jaehaerys, rapidly followed by most of the Great Houses including the Lannisters. Abandoned by his supporters and with rebel armies advancing on King's Landing unopposed, Maegor ran out of options, and was found dead on the Iron Throne by the time the rebels arrived.[21]",
                            "Lord Lyman led three hundred knights to King's Landing to attend the famed Golden Wedding in 49 AC, a grand event which by extension celebrated Jaehaerys's succession to the throne and reconciliation with the Great Houses.[22] The Lannisters hosted Rhaena and her husband, Androw Farman, for a time after they were sent away from Fair Isle. Rhaena eventually departed, however, after determining that Lyman and his wife Lady Jocasta Lannister coveted her dragon eggs, hoping to become the \"second house\" in the realm (displacing the Targaryens' current favorites, the Velaryons and Baratheons).[23] King Jaehaerys never fully trusted Lyman either, accurately judging that he was an ambitious man who wanted to increase Lannister power by edging his way into the Targaryens' inner circle. At multiple points Jaehaerys therefore passed over Lyman for several royal offices and favors: he decided not to name him master of coin in 50 AC, or to name him as the new Hand of the King in 54 AC, or to consider him as master of coin again in 59 AC upon the death of Rego Draz.[24] Lyman and many of his bannermen died months later in 59 AC from the Shivers plague.[8]",

This had more to do with the fact, however, that Daella personally disliked Tymond, for he was a noted womanizer and overly fond of wine. Nonetheless Jaehaerys indulged Daella and let her marry whoever she chose instead of insisting on a political marriage alliance, and ultimately she chose to wed Lord Rodrik Arryn.[8]",
                            "Twenty years later, Lord Tymond Lannister and three hundred westermen attended the Great Council of 101 AC at Harrenhal. Despite the fact that Jaehaerys never granted the Lannisters any royal favors, like the overwhelming majority of lords at the council they voted in favor of Jaehaerys's preferred candidate Viserys (son of his second son) over Laenor Velaryon (Jaehaerys's grandson through his first son's daughter). It was said that a major factor in the decision for many lords was that male proximity predominate in the inheritance, regardless of their current political allegiance.[25] Ser Jason and Ser Tyland Lannister, twin knights, wooed Rhaenyra Targaryen during the princess's visit to Casterly Rock in 112 AC, but without success.[25]"

                            "As King Viserys I Targaryen's reign continued, the Lannisters aligned with the emerging political faction led by House Hightower, specifically Viserys's second wife Queen Alicent Hightower. While the Targaryens treated the Hightowers with respect due to their connections to the leadership of the Faith of the Seven in Oldtown, they were not as influential as the Velaryons or Baratheons and rarely served on the small council in the first century of Targaryen rule. Both the Hightowers and Lannisters ruled powerful port cities on the west coast of Westeros, and increasingly came to resent the Velaryons and their allies who were then pre-eminent at the royal court. Over time these two factions coalesced into \"the greens\" (the Hightowers, Lannisters, and their allies) led by Queen Alicent, and \"the blacks\" (the Velaryons and their allies) led by Viserys's eldest child, Princess Rhaenyra.",
                            "In the third and last decade of Viserys I's rule, the Hightowers came back into power on the small council after the mysterious death of Lord Lyonel Strong in 120 AC. Alicent's father Ser Otto Hightower was brought back to replace him as Hand of the King, and he spent the next decade stacking the small council with green loyalists. Among them, Ser Tyland Lannister became the new master of ships.[26]",
                            "Upon Viserys I's death, a civil war broke out between the two rival branches of House Targaryen, known as the Dance of the Dragons. Lord Jason Lannister declared for Alicent's eldest son, Aegon II Targaryen, while his twin brother Ser Tyland (who had been master of ships) was named as master of coin after the removal of Lord Lyman Beesbury (the only member of the small council who didn't support Aegon II). Tyland seized the royal treasury, swelled by years of peace and prosperity under Viserys, and divided the Crown's gold into four parts. One part was entrusted to the care of the Iron Bank of Braavos for safekeeping, another was sent under strong guard to Casterly Rock, and a third went to Oldtown. The remaining wealth was used by the greens for bribes and gifts and hiring sellswords.[26]",
                            "The bulk of Rhaenyra's supporters in mainland Westeros were in the North, the Vale, and the riverlands, and they began amassing their forces at Harrenhal for an eventual strike on King's Landing. To counter this, the main Lannister army invaded the riverlands from the west, while Prince Aemond Targaryen's forces from King's Landing invaded the riverlands from the south, hoping to catch their enemy on two fronts. As the war progressed, Lord Jason was killed by Longleaf the Lionslayer in the Battle of the Red Fork,[27] and the remaining Lannister host under first Ser Adrian Tarbeck and then Lord Humfrey Lefford was then shattered in the Battle by the Lakeshore, the bloodiest battle of the civil war.[28]",
                            "After the fall of King's Landing, Daemon and Rhaenyra executed several members of Aegon II's small council, but spared Tyland - because they hoped they could force him to confess where he sent the Crown's treasury. Tyland was given over to the torturers, but despite being blinded and gelded, even after months of torture he refused to give up his secret.[20] Rhaenyra's husband, Prince Daemon Targaryen, suggested giving Casterly Rock to Hugh Hammer, which horrified Lord Corlys Velaryon, the Hand of the Queen.[28]",
                            "With Casterly Rock in disarray, Dalton Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, attacked the westerlands to support Rhaenyra's blacks. Lannisport was sacked by the ironborn, but they were unable to conquer the Rock from Jason's widow, Lady Johanna Lannister, who was ruling on behalf of her four-year-old son, Lord Loreon Lannister.[27]",
                            "Near the end of the war, Aegon II retook King's Landing, where they freed the mutilated Tyland - who continued to serve on Aegon II's small council until his death. Many assumed that Tyland would have gone insane from his extensive torture, but surprisingly he retained all his wits and cunning - nor did his blindness affect his shrewd mind. At the end of the war he was sent to the Free Cities to try to hire new sellsword armies, but the final defeat of Aegon II's armies and his death by poisoning then ended the war.[29]",
                            "Ser Tyland returned to Westeros, and was named the new Hand of the King to Rhaenyra's eldest surviving son, King Aegon III Targaryen, whose execution Tyland had once proposed. Tyland had an odd sense of honor, in that he only felt compelled to obey oaths he had personally sworn, not those made by his ancestors or his allies, but once he had personally sworn an oath he would keep it even to his enemies. Ser Tyland served loyally and ably as Hand early in the regency of Aegon III, trying to hold the realm together after the devastation of the war and the harsh winter that followed. Both Tyland and his sister-in-law Lady Johanna (current regent for House Lannister) attended Aegon III's coronation, and his wedding to Aegon II's daughter, Princess Jaehaera Targaryen.[30]",
                            "Although the Dance of the Dragons had ended with Aegon III on the Iron Throne, Dalton refused to make peace with the westerlands. Lady Johanna won a victory over the ironborn at Kayce, but her plan to recover Fair Isle ended with the deaths of Ser Erwin Lannister and Lords Prester and Tarbeck.[31] Lord Unwin Peake, Tyland's successor as Aegon's Hand, tasked Lord Alyn Velaryon with bringing peace to the west. Dalton was killed by Tess, one of his many salt wives, however, and the ironmen began to retreat. Johanna presented Alyn Oakenfist with a golden seahorse when his fleet finally arrived in the west, but the admiral declined her suggestion to attack the Iron Islands.[32]",
                            "Johanna took advantage of the struggle for power in the Iron Islands by having Ser Leo Costayne invade the archipelago with a Lannister army. In return for conquering the isles for young Lord Loreon, Leo hoped to win Johanna's hand. The Lannister army eventually faltered and Leo was slain on Great Wyk, but hundreds of ironborn ships and villages were destroyed during the invasion. Many ironborn nobles were killed in the campaign, and Johanna had the captured Rodrik Greyjoy gelded and made him a fool for Loreon.[33]",
                            "Meanwhile, after the Dance ended in 131 AC Tyland Lannister was heavily involved in dealing with the outbreak of the Daughters' War in the Free Cities, and the complicated political maneuverings that followed as the multi-sided war spilled over into the narrow sea and involved the fleets of Westeros. Two years into the regency of Aegon III, however, Westeros was further devastated by the outbreak of the Winter Fever. While it never spread to the west coasts of the continent, King's Landing was hard hit. Ser Tyland ordered a quarantine and was locked inside the city along with the rest of its inhabitants, where he was one of the last to die from the plague in 133 AC."

Instead of returning Jaime to Lord Edmure Tully at Riverrun, Roose decides to send his captive on to King's Landing while leaving Brienne with Vargo.[50] Jaime returns to Harrenhal in time to rescue Brienne from Harrenhal's bear pit.[46] Steelshanks Walton escorts them to the capital and Qyburn treats Jaime's stump.[46]",

With Renly Baratheon and Robb dead, Stannis Baratheon repelled and with few followers, and the Greyjoys concentrating on the north, Lannister power is at its zenith.[108]",

Cersei refuses to give up her power and appoints Ser Daven Lannister as the new Warden of the West to slight Kevan, and Ser Damion Lannister is named castellan of the Rock.[43] Finally she makes Ser Harys Swyft the Hand, because he is a tractable man and Kevan is wend to his daughter, Dorna Swyft.[115] Kevan helps his son, Lord Lancel Lannister, at Darry and then continues on to the Rock.[117]",

When Meria refused to submit to the Targaryens, Rhaenys departed Dorne.[8] The Targaryens returned in 4 AC, starting the First Dornish War. When their forces arrived at Sunspear, Meria had vanished. King Aegon I and Queen Rhaenys Targaryen declared themselves victorious and left Lord Jon Rosby as Castellan of Sunspear as they returned to King's Landing. However, the Dornishmen quickly came out of hiding, retaking Sunspear. Lord Rosby was captured, and thrown from a window atop the Spear Tower by Princess Meria herself.[9] In later phases of the war, the Targaryens burned every Dornish stronghold at least once, with the exception of Sunspear and its shadow city. According to the Dornishmen, the Targaryens were did not dare to attack Sunspear as they feared that Princess Meria might have purchased a device from Lys to slay their dragons. In his Conjectures Archmaester Timotty suggests that Aegon hoped to turn the Dornish against the Martells by leaving them the only ones unharmed, and letters have been discovered in which marcher lords claimed to the Dornish that the Martells had bought their safety. However, the tactics did not work.[9]",
                            "After nine years, the First Dornish War came to an end in 13 AC. When the elderly Princess Meria died, her son Nymor assumed rule over Dorne. Desiring peace, he sent his daughter Deria to King's Landing with an escort as an peace envoy. She brought with her the skull of Rhaenys's dragon Meraxes and a letter from Prince Nymor. Although at first determined to refuse the peace offer, Aegon agreed to it after reading Nymor's letter.[9] During the remainder of King Aegon I's reign, the Martells and Targaryens remained on good terms. In 23 AC, King Aegon I and his son Aenys visited Sunspear for a \"feast of friendship\" celebrating the tenth anniversary of the peace accord with Princess Deria, now the Princess of Dorne.[10] In 37 AC, as the Vulture King troubled the lands surrounding the border between Dorne and the Iron Throne, Princess Deria insisted to King Aenys I Targaryen that she was doing what she could to end the rebellion, many suspected that she was secretly giving the rebel her support.[11][12]",

Rebellion continued until Daeron's death in 161 AC,[17] after which his brother, King Baelor I, travelled to Sunspear and agreed to a peace with House Martell. This included a betrothal between Myriah Martell and Prince Daeron Targaryen.[18] Myriah's brother Maron was Daeron's most important supporter,[19] and upon Daeron's ascension, agreed to join Dorne under Targaryen rule. This became official in 187 AC, when Maron married Daeron's sister Daenerys.[20][21]",

These complaints, among others, were reasons causing several lords to oppose Daeron II's rule during the First Blackfyre Rebellion.[22]",
                            "In 273 AC, the Princess of Dorne took her younger children Oberyn and Elia to meet potential suitors. Their final destination was Casterly Rock, and despite learning of Lady Joanna Lannister's death while at Oldtown, they continued their journey. Oberyn Martell believes that his mother had planned with Joanna to marry either Elia or Oberyn to one of Joanna's twins, Jaime and Cersei, since there was an empty cabin on their ship meant for someone of high birth. Lord Tywin Lannister ignored them for weeks. When the Princess of Dorne eventually broached the subject of marriage to him, both matches were brusquely refused. He claimed Cersei was meant to marry Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, and suggested the new-born dwarf Tyrion for Elia instead, which was taken as an insult.[23][24][25] Shortly thereafter, at the age of sixteen, Oberyn was caught abed with Lord Edgar Yronwood's paramour. To settle the situation, the two fought a duel in which both took wounds. Edgar's wounds festered and killed him, causing rumors Oberyn's blade in the duel had been poisoned.[24] To make peace between the two houses, Oberyn was temporarily exiled.[26]"

A year later, he apparently abducted Lyanna, sparking Robert's Rebellion.[28] Prince Doran Martell, furious at Elia's mistreatment, was slow to lend aid to the Targaryens during the war, but eventually sent ten thousand men to fight for the throne at the Battle of the Trident.[29] One of the casualties at the battle was Prince Lewyn Martell of the Kingsguard.

Tywald served Robert as a squire during the Peake Uprising, but Robert and Tywald were killed in battle at Starpike in 233 AC.[9] Lady Ellyn, who had long anticipated becoming the Lady of Casterly Rock, was unwilling to forsake that dream. She persuaded Tywald's twin, Tion, to set aside his own fiancé and espouse her instead. During this time, Lady Ellyn held a splendid court at the Rock, staging magnificent tourneys and balls and filling the Rock with musicians, mummers and Reynes. She bestowed honors, offices and lands on her brothers, Roger and Reynard, and other relatives. An acerbic hunchback, Lord Toad, was heard saying, \"Lady Ellyn must be a sorceress, for she has made it rain inside the Rock all year\".[3]",

After the War of the Ninepenny Kings, Tytos's son and heir, Ser Tywin Lannister, demanded repayment of the gold that was lent out, but Roger reportedly laughed and told his vassals to do nothing. This eventually led Tywin to summon the Reynes and the Tarbecks to answer for their crimes. They chose defiance instead and with it, started the Reyne-Tarbeck rebellion against their Lannister overlords.",

After an unsuccessful battle against the Lannister host led by Tywin, Ser Reynard and the wounded Lord Roger took refuge in the mines underneath Castamere. Reynard, once his folk were safe, offered terms to Tywin. Instead Tywin ordered the sealing of Castamere's entrances and the diverting of nearby water into the mine, causing the deaths of all within.[10]",

                            "Nestor's daughter Myranda Royce was once married, but her husband died while they were having sex on her wedding night. Nestor offers Myranda as a match for Harrold Hardyng, but his offer is rejected by Lady Anya Waynwood.[11]"

Bran the Builder is said to have raised Winterfell, the seat of the Starks, and the Wall,[39] and other legends connect him with Storm's End[40] and the Hightower.[41] The Starks were Kings of Winter in the north for eight thousand years[33][42] since the Age of Heroes, possibly beginning with Bran the Builder. The Night's King, the attainted thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, has been suggested to have been a Stark, among other possibilities.[43] The Night's King is said to have been defeated by Brandon the Breaker and Joramun.[44]",
                            "The ancient Starks gradually defeated rival kings, such as the Barrow Kings to their south and the Red Kings to their east.[45] For several millennia, the Starks were not the uncontested Kings in the North. Their primary antagonists, the Red Kings from House Bolton of the Dreadfort, swore fealty some thousand years ago, ending their flaying ways. Meanwhile, King Jon Stark drove pirates from the White Knife, and the Wolf's Den was built at its mouth. This stronghold was often granted to sons and grandsons of the King in the North; one such branch, the Greystarks, was extinguished after allying with the Boltons against the Starks.[46] King Jon's son, Rickard, defeated the Marsh King and married his daughter, bringing the Neck into Winterfell's realm under the lordship of House Reed.[19]",
                            "When Andals attempted to conquer the north, King Theon Stark made common cause with House Bolton and defeated Argos Sevenstar in the Battle of the Weeping Water, after which he raised a fleet and sailed to Andalos. There he took revenge by sacking and putting hundreds to death. He later conquered the Three Sisters, and battled against the ironborn, driving them away from Cape Kraken and Bear Island and slaying Ravos Hoare. Both places were later taken back by King Loron Greyjoy, and King Rodrik Stark took Bear Island back after Loron's death. It is said that he did so by winning a wrestling match, though some scholars doubt the truth of this tale.[47][19] Rodrik's sons and grandsons took back Cape Kraken.[45] King Theon also smashed a rebellion in the Rills, and gave aid to the Night's Watch against wildlings.[45]",

This conflict, the War Across the Water, lasted for a thousand years, during which time the Starks thrice landed on the Fingers.[49][50] During King Edric Stark's hundred-year long reign, the Wolf's Den, already torched by House Arryn, was captured by slavers from the Stepstones. Edric's great-grandson, King Brandon \"Ice Eyes\", took back the Wolf's Den.[46] After a thousand years of war, the Arryns were victorious over the Starks, and the Valemen have ruled over the Three Sisters ever since.[49]",

With the burning of Harrenhal and the Field of Fire in mind, however, Torrhen submitted without battle to Aegon I Targaryen.[55] Since the time of the King Who Knelt, the Starks have held the north for the Lords of the Seven Kingdoms as Wardens of the North.[56] Queen Rhaenys Targaryen arranged the marriage of Torrhen's daughter to Ronnel Arryn, the Lord of the Eyrie, in an attempt to knit the new realm together.[57][58] There are letters at the Citadel which suggest that Torrhen only agreed to this match after much protest, and that his sons had refused to attend the wedding.[57] Torrhen's sons did not agree with the rule of House Targaryen. Some spoke of rebelling and raising the Stark banner,[57] though no rebellion has been mentioned to have ultimately taken place.",
                            "For the next full century after the Conquest, the Starks remained aloof from the royal court and disinterested in politics affecting the rest of Westeros. Historians such as Yandel barely remark upon the Starks during this time period, and even Gyldayn's definitive history offers only slightly more information about this uneventful era (thus a full family tree has not yet been revealed for the Starks between the Conquest and the Dance of the Dragons). Torrhen was succeeded by \"Brandon the Boisterous\". At some point rule of the North passed to Roderick Stark, and Roderick was succeeded by \"Brandon the Boastful\". Brandon the Boastful attended the Golden Wedding in 49 AC, along with his sons Walton and Alaric, though Brandon died soon after his return from it to the North.[59]",
                            "Despite earlier rumblings of dissent by Torrhen's sons, the Starks were not among the wave of localized rebellions that popped up against Aegon the Conqueror's son Aenys I (in the Vale, the Iron Islands, and at Harrenhal). The Starks took no part in the ongoing Faith Militant uprising against Aenys and then his tyrannical brother Maegor the Cruel: as the North follows the old gods they did not heed the High Septon's calls for rebellion. Moreover the North was never singled out for mistreatment by Maegor, so they never joined either of the rebellions against him by Aenys's sons, but they didn't actively support Maegor either. The only brief point when the Starks became involved in the conflicts was after Maegor's death. Captured members of the Faith Militant had been exiled to the Night's Watch by Maegor, and later Aenys's son Jaehaerys I exiled many of Maegor's hardcore supporters to the Wall as well, including surviving members of his old Kingsguard. Neither group had love for Jaehaerys, so soon afterward in 50 AC the two groups made common cause to rebel against the leadership of the Watch. Lord Walton Stark called his bannermen to intervene and crushed the deserters, but survivors fled beyond the Wall: Walton pursued them but was ambushed by wildlings and killed by giants. Walton was succeeded by his brother Alaric Stark.[59]",
                            "In 58 AC Queen Alysanne Targaryen visited Winterfell and was received by Lord Alaric, who was initially cold to her and Jaehaerys: the new king had spared the lives of the men who rebeled against the Night's Watch by exiling them to the Wall instead of executing them, and Alaric felt that had Jaehaerys executed them his brother would still be alive. Alaric was gradually charmed by Alysanne's visit, however, and his daughter ​Alarra grew particularly close to the queen during her visit.[28] Alaric did not attend the tourney in King's Landing which celebrated the tenth anniversary of Jaehaerys's coronation, sending his sons instead.[28] Alaric ordered his bannermen to put aside half of their harvests in anticipation of the winter of 59–60 AC, but not all of the northmen obeyed, resulting in famine.[60] The Shivers plague followed later that winter, though no specific casualties are mentioned in the North and Alaric survived. Lord Alaric died in 72 AC and was succeeded by his grandson, Edric Stark, as Alaric's two sons had preceded him in death.[60]",
                            "Alaric's relationship with the Targaryens remained complicated throughout his reign. According to Archmaester Gyldayn, Alysanne charmed a reluctant Alaric[N 3] into granting the New Gift to the Night's Watch because, even though Alaric was a strong friend to the Watch, he knew the northern lords who already held the lands in question would not be happy to be given away.[28] According to Maester Yandel, however, the Starks were opposed to the royal demand for a different reason: the Starks feared that, under the control of the Castle Black, the New Gift would inevitably decline, for the Night's Watch would always look northward and never give much thought to their new tenants to the south. Time proved this criticism correct, for as the decades passed the Night's Watch neglected the New Gift and it fell into disuse. Yandel cites that there are archived letters in the Citadel sent by the sons of Lord Alaric, asking the maesters about precedents against forced donations of land. Whatever the case, on the whole Jaehaerys and Alysanne became popular in the North due to their other generous donations to the Night's Watch, and their construction of the new Kingsroad extending from the Neck to Winterfell and the Wall.[57]"

                            "Edric was eventually succeeded by Ellard Stark, who took part in the Great Council of 101 AC to determine the new heir of the elderly Jaehaerys after his second son's death. The final vote came to a choice between Viserys Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys's second son) and Laenor Velaryon (grandson of Jaehaerys through his first son's daughter). Viserys was the candidate Jaehaerys himself preferred, and he won the final vote by a landslide, though the Starks were among the minority of lords who had supported Laenor (and one of only two Great Houses, the other being the Baratheons). Yandel believed in his history that the reason why Ellard voted against Jaehaerys's preferred successor is because the Starks were still bitter about Jaehaerys forcing them to donate the New Gift to the Night's Watch, leading to its mismanagement. This vote would have longstanding consequences, as it pushed the Starks closer to the Velaryon faction at Viserys I's royal court, and through them to ultimately side with Rhaenyra during the Dance of the Dragons.[57]",
                            "At some point after 101 AC, Ellard was succeeded by Benjen Stark, and later Benjen was succeeded by his son Rickon. Rickon died in 121 AC, and was succeeded as the nominal Lord of Winterfell by his only surviving son, the thirteen-year-old Cregan Stark. Rickon's brother, Bennard, served as regent during Cregan's minority. When Cregan came of age in 126 AC, however, Bennard was slow to surrender his power. Relations grew strained between Bennard and Cregan as the young Lord of Winterfell chafed under the limits imposed on him by his uncle. Ultimately, Cregan rose up against his uncle, imprisoned Bennard and his sons, and took rule of the North into his own hands.[61]",
                            "In 129 AC, as the Dance of the Dragons began, Prince Jacaerys Velaryon recruited Lord Cregan's aid for his mother, Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, known as the Pact of Ice and Fire,[57] even though the north was considered to be too remote to be of much influence in the war.[62] Cregan sent the Winter Wolves under Roderick Dustin, Lord of Barrowton, and knights from White Harbor led by Ser Medrick and Ser Torrhen Manderly.[63] After the gathering of one last harvest before winter,[64] Cregan led a great army of men, childless, homeless, unwed, or old men, and younger sons, to King's Landing. He arrived after King Aegon II Targaryen had been poisoned, however, and though he had hoped to punish those lords who had supported the late king, Corlys Velaryon, Lord of the Tides, had already sent out ravens suing for peace. While the court awaited replies, Cregan held sway and arrested all those involved in Aegon II's death, as he objected to the murder of a king. The as-yet-uncrowned Aegon III Targaryen was cowed into naming Cregan as Hand of the King, though Cregan served only a day in that office, a time known as the Hour of the Wolf. Lord Stark held trials for twenty-one out of twenty-two of his prisoners, with Corlys the only one spared a trial. Aegon III pardoned Lord Velaryon and restored his titles to him, which Cregan allowed when Aly Blackwood offered the Hand her own hand in marriage. Cregan returned north the next day.[65]",
                            "During the Regency era that followed the Dance, Cregan struggled to hold the North together against several threats. A devastating winter had already begun late in the war which ultimately lasted six years, and in 132 AC the North was one of the first regions in Westeros struck by the Winter Fever, which continued through 133 AC. With the North weakened by winter, famine, and plague, a large wildling war-band led by Sylas the Grim seized on the opportunity to force their way south of the Wall. His force of 3,000 raiders overwhelmed the Night's Watch at Queensgate and proceeded to plunder the lands to the south. Lord Cregan rallied what few remaining able-bodied men were left among his bannermen, then rode out to hunt down and destroy Sylas's raiding bands.[66]",
                            "Cregan's eldest son and heir was Rickon, named after his own father. Rickon predeceased his father when died in one of the final battles of the Conquest of Dorne, during the reign of King Daeron I Targaryen. The North lamented Rickon's death, for the subsequent reigns of Cregan's younger sons after him were troublesome.[57]"

Therefore it's possible that a few Northern lords may have sided with the Blackfyres, but overall the North saw little fighting.[67]",
                            "The decades after Cregan Stark's death were a troublesome time for the North, as Cregan's descendants squabbled amongst each other and dealt with numerous more local threats in rapid succession.",
                            "Cregan Stark had five sons: Rickon, Jonnel, Edric, Barthogan, and Brandon. Though Rickon Stark predeceased his father, he was survived by his own two daughters, Sansa and Serena, and by the known laws of succesion they should have been ahead of Rickon's younger brothers in line of inheritance - however, northern succession laws may simply be different,[68] there has never been a ruling Queen of Winter or ruling Lady of Winterfell for example,[69] and promigeniture is not nessesarily binding elsewere in the seven kingdoms either.[70] Whatever the case was, Cregan's second son Jonnel Stark succeeded Cregan upon his death, marrying his own half-niece Sansa.[71] Cregan's third son Edric Stark married Rickon's other daughter Serena.[71] Jonnel's marriage to Sansa was childless, but upon his death rule passed not to Cregan's third son Edric, but to his fourth son Barthogan Stark.[72] While it is possible that Edric predeceased his younger brother, Edric did have two sons and two daughters with Serena, and the daughters had children of their own, [71] and all of these should have been ahead in the line of succession to Barthogan. The exact reasons and circumstances under which Barthogan became Lord of Winterfell are as yet unknown.",
                            "Barthogan himself later died childless, when he was slain in the Skagosi rebellion during the reign of Daeron II Targaryen,[72] and he was succeeded by Cregan's fifth and final son, Brandon, from whom the later generations of House Stark descend. Convoluted succession challenges remained for decades, possibly through Serena and Edric's children - and between Brandon's own rival grandchildren. Brandon was succeeded by his eldest son Rodwell Stark, who died without issue, after which rule passed to his younger brother Beron Stark. The grandson of Cregan, Beron was mortally wounded fighting off an incursion by Dagon Greyjoy's ironborn, and as he lay dying in Winterfell multiple Stark widows pushed their children's rival succession claims against the others - only for the unlikely traveling duo Dunk and Egg to become embroiled in the ensuing events.[73][74]",
                            "Ultimately Beron was succeeded by his eldest son, Donnor Stark, but when he died without issue rule passed to second son Willam Stark. In 226 AC, Raymun Redbeard, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, led a large wildling invasion. Lord William and Harmond Umber, Lord of the Last Hearth, met the wildling host in battle on the shores of Long Lake. Although Willam was killed by Raymun, his younger brother, Artos, avenged him by slaying the King-Beyond-the-Wall.[75][54]",
                            "Willam was succeeded upon his death by his son Edwyle Stark, father of Rickard Stark and grandfather of Eddard Stark."

House Reyne became close allies with the Tarbecks, and the Tarbecks used funds from Lord Tytos Lannister to rebuild crumbling Tarbeck Hall. Walderan increased the number of household knights under his command from twenty to five hundred.[6]",

In retaliation, Ellyn imprisoned two Lannisters of Lannisport, as well as Stafford Lannister, whose sister Joanna was betrothed to Tywin.

After Tywin quickly defeated Walderan's host, he ordered the beheadings of Lord Tarbeck and his supporters. Ellyn and Tion the Red were killed during Tywin's assault on Tarbeck Hall; Tywin supposedly smiled when Tarbeck Hall collapsed with Lady Ellyn within.[7]"

Before his own reign, Maekar I Targaryen used the three-headed dragon, quartered,[12] while his son, Prince Aerion Targaryen, changed the colors of the three heads - one orange, one yellow, one red - while the flames they breathed had a sheen of gold leaf.[13] King Aegon II Targaryen used a golden dragon as his personal banner.[14] In line with the sigil colors, most Targaryens used armor black of color (e.g., Rhaegar Targaryen, who had the three-headed dragon wrought in rubies on his breast plate,[1][15][16] Valarr Targaryen,[13] and Aemond Targaryen, whose night-black armor was chased with gold[14]).",

The Targaryens eventually build a third seat, Summerhall, in 188 AC, which was granted to several younger sons of House Targaryen,[18] who were granted the title \"Prince of Summerhall\".[13][19]",

Deaths in battle, especially during the Dance of the Dragons, and a growing infirmity in each following generation caused the family's stable to dwindle.

The family resided in Valyria until Daenys Targaryen, also known as Daenys the Dreamer, the daughter of Lord Aenar Targaryen, had visions of a cataclysm that would come over Valyria. Aenar sold his estates in Valyria and moved his wives, children, other relatives, slaves, wealth, and five dragons (including Balerion) to Dragonstone, an island at the entrance of Blackwater Bay and the westernmost outpost of Valyrian influence, where he took possession of a castle of the same name, in 114 BC. Twelve years later the Doom descended on the city of Valyria, leading to the collapse of the Freehold. The Targaryens were the only dragonriders of Valyria to survive. In the century that followed, four of the five dragons of House Targaryen died, with only Balerion surviving. Two more dragons, Vhagar and Meraxes, were hatched from eggs on Dragonstone, however.[5]",

Aegon, mounted on his dragon Balerion, flew first to Pentos to meet its prince, and then to Lys, where he set the Volantene fleet aflame. With Volantis's rule at an end, he returned to Dragonstone, and focused his attention to the lands west, which had always been of interest to him.[5]"

                    "Aegon Targaryen, Lord of Dragonstone, aspired to unite the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros under one ruler. Slightly more than a hundred years after the Doom of Valyria, in 2 BC, he began his conquest, in which he was aided by his two sister-wives, Rhaenys and Visenya. All three were dragonriders, and used their dragons, Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar in battle. Aegon's Conquest lasted for two years. It began with Aegon's landing at the mouth of the Blackwater Rush with a small force, and ended when Aegon was anointed king by the High Septon in Oldtown. In total, he had managed to conquer six of the seven kingdoms, with only Dorne remaining defiant. During the war House Gardener, which had ruled the Reach, and House Hoare, which had ruled the Iron Islands and the riverlands, were extinguished, while House Durrandon, which had reigned over the Stormlands, was continued through the female line.[5] From the swords of his enemies, Aegon created the Iron Throne, and the dynasty he began would rule for nearly three hundred years.[5][36] Aegon had constructed a wooden castle, the Aegonfort, at the place where he had first come to shore, and the town that grew around it became King's Landing, the kingdom's new capital.[5][17] Dragonstone remained in the possession of the Targaryens as well, and was one of Aegon's favorite places.[17] The region around King's Landing became known as the crownlands.",
                    "In 4 AC, Aegon's wars of conquest continued with the First Dornish War, during which he and Rhaenys attempted to bring the Dornish under Targaryen rule as well.[17][37] A bloody war, during which Queen Rhaenys Targaryen was killed with her dragon, Meraxes, at Hellholt in 10 AC.[37] An assassination attempt on Aegon that same year led to the creation of the Kingsguard, who would guard the kings of the realm for centuries to come.[17] The First Dornish War eventually ended in 13 AC, after Prince Nymor Martell, the Prince of Dorne, had sent his daughter Deria to King's Landing with a letter and the skull of Meraxes. Though the contents of the letter have never been revealed, Aegon agreed to an end of the war the next day.[37]"

                    "Aegon I Targaryen died in 37 AC, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Aenys I Targaryen. Almost immediately, Aenys faced four rebellions which had grown out of dissent, dreams of the old days or of vengeance, and of the fact that Aenys and his younger brother, Maegor, had both been born from incestuous marriages. A bandit named Harren the Red, claiming to be a grandson of Harren the Black, took Harrenhal and killed Lord Gargon Qoherys. In the Vale, Lord Ronnel Arryn and his family were taken hostage by his younger brother, Jonos Arryn. On the Iron Islands, a man claimed to be the priest-king Lodos, finally returned from visiting his father after more than three centuries. And in Dorne, the Vulture King raised thirty thousand followers against the Targaryens.[38] The rebels were swiftly defeated by the actions of Aenys's subjects and Maegor. Lord Goren Greyjoy killed the so-called priest-king, and sent his head to King Aenys. Lord Royce of Runestone defeated the supporters of Jonos Arryn, though this caused the death of Lord Ronnel and his family when Jonos threw them out of the Moon Door in the Eyrie.[38] Prince Maegor, who had claimed the dragon Balerion after his father's death, eventually flew up to the Eyrie and had Jonos and his followers executed.[38][39] The Vulture King had made the mistake of splitting his large army, and was defeated during the Vulture Hunt, in which Lord Orys Baratheon and several other Marcher lords, including Lord Dondarrion, Lady Caron, and Lord Sam Tarly, marched against him.[38][39] And the last rebel, Harren the Red, was eventually caught by Aenys's Hand of the King, Lord Alyn Stokeworth. Though Stokeworth was killed by Harren in the fighting that ensued, Harren himself was slain shortly after. As Stokeworth's replacement, Aenys named Maegor as his Hand.[38]",
                    "The next challenges Aenys faced came from the Faith of the Seven. Even though the Targaryens had been followers of the Faith of the Seven since before the Conquest, the Targaryens held themselves apart from the laws of gods and men. By marrying both his sisters, Aegon I had continued both the Valyrian practice of incestuous marriage, which was considered a sin in the eyes of the Seven, as well as the more rarely practiced custom of polygamy, even though the Faith of the Seven considered marriage only possible between one man and one wife.[38] Even though Aegon I had always been careful regarding the Faith, the High Septons had never declared his marriages lawful, though they had not spoken up against Aegon's polygamous and incestuous marriages either.[39] However, when Queen Visenya Targaryen had suggested, in 23 AC, that her son Maegor should be married to Aenys's infant daughter, Princess Rhaena, the High Septon had protested, and Maegor had been married to the High Septon's niece, Ceryse Hightower, instead.[38] After sixteen years of marriage, however, Maegor remained childless. Following the birth of Aenys I's sixth child in 39 AC,[39] Maegor took a second wife, Alys Harroway. This greatly angered the Faith, and Aenys gave his brother the choice between abandoning Alys, or going in exile. Maegor chose the latter option, after which he left for Pentos.[38]",
                    "The Faith remained discontent. Though they had not objected to Aenys's own marriage in 22 AC, to his cousin Alyssa Velaryon, new troubles arose in 41 AC when Aenys married his eldest daughter, Rhaena, to his eldest son and heir, Prince Aegon. The uproar this marriage caused led to the start of the Faith Militant uprising.[38] Aenys fled to Dragonstone, but fell sick and died in 42 AC. Dowager Queen Visenya immediately called Maegor back from his exile, allowing him to claim the throne. Maegor took King's Landing back from the Faith Militant, though he would spent his entire reign fighting against them. In addition, he fought against Aenys's heir, Aegon, and killed both him and his dragon Quicksilver in 43 AC.[28]",
                    "Maegor's reign was a cruel one. He finished the construction of the Red Keep, which had begun in 35 AC, during his reign,[17][28] though he honored his moniker \"the Cruel\" when he killed all the construction workers after work was completed. He had come back from his exile with a third wife, Tyanna, but was still without an heir towards the end of his reign. Denouncing the claims of Aenys's only surviving son, Jaehaerys, Maegor married his three Black Brides, one of whom was Jaehaerys's sister, Rhaena, and named Rhaena's daughter as his heir until he had a child of his own. While support for Jaehaerys grew, support for Maegor dwindled. When Maegor died mysteriously in 48 AC, Jaehaerys succeeded him.[28]"

Unwilling to submit to her brother, Rhaenyra declared war, and the resulting conflict over the succession, called the Dance of the Dragons (129–131 AC), divided the kingdom. During this bloody war, thousands died, as did most of the Targaryen dragons. Rhaenyra herself was devoured by Sunfyre, Aegon II's dragon, in late 130 AC while her son Aegon the Younger looked on.[41][14] Despite her death and Aegon the Younger's capture, the war raged on for another half year.[14] Aegon II was forced into betrothing his daughter and only remaining child, Jaehaera, to Rhaenyra's eldest surviving son, Aegon the Younger, and name them his heirs,[42][43] though he planned to remarry.[41] The was lasted until mid-131 AC, when Aegon II was poisoned by his own councilors.[41]",
                    "With the war at an end, the eleven-year old Aegon the Younger ascended the throne as Aegon III Targaryen. Until Aegon reached the age of sixteen, the realm was ruled by a regency. Aegon's younger brother Viserys, formerly thought to have died during the Dance, returned to Westeros, married to Lady Larra Rogare. Viserys served as his brother's Hand of the King towards the end of his reign. The Targaryen dragons had been greatly diminished in numbers because of the war, and when the last dragon died in 153 AC, Viserys convinced Aegon to sent for nine mages from Essos, to allow them to use their arts to hatch a clutch of dragon eggs.

In 258 AC, the Prince of Dorne and several other Dornish lords bent their knees at the Submission of Sunspear. The hinterlands were pacified by 159 AC, and Daeron returned to King's Landing with fourteen highborn Dornish hostages, leaving Lord Harlen Tyrell behind to keep the peace.[44]",
                    "However, Daeron's conquest did not last. The smallfolk rebelled, and though Lord Tyrell attempted to fight back, traveling from holdfast to holdfast, the rebels always struck back.[44] After he was murdered in his bed at Sandstone, all of Dorne rose in open rebellion, and they managed to liberate themselves within a fortnight.[45] Daeron returned to Dorne in 160 AC, and when the Dornish requested to discuss peace terms the next year, they betrayed Daeron by attacking him and his retinue beneath the peace banner. One of Daeron's Kingsguard knights surrendered, while another, his cousin Aemon the Dragonknight, was captured. Three other Kingsguard knights were slain, as was Daeron I himself.[44] Though his reign had lasted only four years, it had been a bloody one. It is said that ten thousand men died conquering Dorne, and another forty or fifty thousand died trying to keep it.[44][46] Only eighteen years old at the time of his death, Daeron I had never been married[N 3] and left no issue.

He walked barefoot from King's Landing to Sunspear, escorting the hostages home, and met with the Prince of Dorne. They forged a peace, and Baelor agreed to betroth his cousin, Prince Daeron (his uncle Viserys's grandson), to the eldest child of the Prince of Dorne, Princess Myriah Martell. During his journey back home, Baelor passed by Wyl, where he freed his cousin Aemon, though he was bitten by venomous snakes in the process. When he finally returned to King's Landing, Baelor convinced the High Septon to dissolve his marriage to his sister, Daena, whom he had wed in 160 AC, as it had never been consummated. He then locked Daena and her sisters Rhaena and Elaena in the Maidenvault, to \"preserve their innocence\". Baelor I was focused mostly on the Faith of the Seven, and even took a septon's vows, ensuring he would never father heirs. His edicts became more focused on spiritual matters as his reign continued, causing unease among the highborn. Baelor began the construction of a new sept, though it would not be completed until after his death. Baelor also began to fast more frequently and for longer periods of time towards the end of his reign. And when his sister and former wife Daena, who had escaped the Maidenvault on several occasions during Baelor's reign, gave birth to a bastard son she named Daemon Waters in late 170 AC, Baelor began a forty-day fast (even though another lengthy fast several years before had nearly killed him). Baelor was found collapsed on the forty-first day, and died soon after, in 171 AC.[47]",

                    "Viserys II was succeeded by his eldest son, Aegon IV, who was rumored to have had a hand in his father's death.[49] Aegon's reign was filled with corruption, and he gave and took from noble houses as he wished, whenever he wanted to.[49] He had been married to his sister Naerys in 153 AC.[48] They differed greatly in personalities,[48] and childbirth was hard on her. When their son Daeron was born in 153 AC, the Grand Maester warned that another childbirth could kill Naerys. However, Aegon took no heed, and impregnated Naerys three more times. Only one child, however, survived: Princess Daenerys, born in 172 AC. Naerys died in childbirth several years later.[49]",
                    "Aegon was very promiscuous, both before and during his reign. He had bastard children by several women, though he only acknowledged those fathered upon his nine official mistresses, with one exception: his cousin Daena's son, Daemon Waters. In 182 AC, Aegon openly recognized the boy as his own son[50] and gifted him the Valyrian steel sword Blackfyre.[49] There were some who felt that the sword symbolized the monarchy,[51] as the sword had been passed on from king to king since Aegon the Conqueror (with one exception[N 4]). Aegon's public gift of the sword to his bastard son was one of the seeds from which the First Blackfyre Rebellion would eventually grow. Following the acquisition of the sword, Daemon took the surname \"Blackfyre\" for himself.[49]",
                    "Aegon IV's relationship with his trueborn heir was more troublesome. Once he was old enough to voice his own opinions, Prince Daeron and Aegon IV quarreled more often, and towards the end of Aegon's reign, Daeron became his chief obstacle. When Aegon attempted to invade Dorne with wooden dragons and a fleet in 174 AC, the homeland of Daeron's wife, Myriah Martell, rumors were heard for the first time that Daeron had been fathered by Aegon's brother Aemon instead of Aegon. Though Aemon defeated Ser Morgil Hastwyck in a trial by combat when he accused Naerys of adultery, the rumors remained, and it was believed that they had originated with King Aegon himself, though he denied it. Following the death of both Aemon and Naerys, Aegon began more openly to refer to Daeron's illegitimacy, though he never disowned him. Finally, on his death bed in 184 AC, Aegon IV legitimized all of his bastards.[49] Though his successor, his son Daeron II Targaryen, could not undo this, he made attempts to keep his half-siblings close.[18]",
                    "Daeron II began his reign by negotiating with his brother-in-law, Maron Martell, who had inherited the rule of Dorne. He arranged a marriage between Maron and his sister, Daenerys, which occurred in 187 AC. Following the wedding, Dorne officially joined the realm, and did fealty to the Iron Throne. However, while the Seven Kingdoms were now finally united, dissatisfaction grew with the concessions that Dorne had won, as well as the growing Dornish influence at Daeron's court. Daeron II's heir, Prince Baelor, favored his Dornish mother in his physical appearance, and more and more lords began to wish for \"the old days\", when the Dornish had been the enemy in battle, and not rivals for power at court.[18]",
                    "These lords looked at Daemon Blackfyre, and saw in him a warrior, tall and powerful, with the hallmarks of Old Valyria (deep purple eyes, silver-gold hair down to his shoulders), who was described as having had an \"almost inhumane beauty\", being \"half a god among mortal men\".[18][50] Though it took many years, talk eventually turned into treason when Daemon planned to make his claim for the Iron Throne. The First Blackfyre Rebellion began in early 196 AC and lasted nigh on a year, ending late in the year with the Battle of the Redgrass Field.[18] Daemon and his two eldest sons, Aegon and Aemon Blackfyre, were killed,[18][12] whereas Aegor Rivers, another one of Daeron II's half-brothers, fled into exile with Daemon's remaining children and the sword Blackfyre. For a while, Rivers resided in Tyrosh with Daemon's family,[10] until he formed the Golden Company in 212 AC.[52]"

However, in its final year, 209 AC, problems began when Daeron's heir and Hand of the King, Prince Baelor, died when defending a hedge knight called Duncan in a trial of seven at the tourney at Ashford Meadow.[18][13] It is believed that Baelor's youngest brother Maekar, who had fought on the side of the two accusers, his own eldest two sons Daeron and Aerion, had been the one to fatally his Baelor's head.[18][13] Following Baelor's cremation, Maekar sent Aerion into exile, while he allowed his youngest son, nicknamed \"Egg\", to squire for Duncan, so he could be taught humility and honor.[13]",
                    "Not long after the death of Baelor, the Great Spring Sickness began. Thousands died as a result, and among the victims were Daeron II and his two most immediate heirs, Baelor's two sons Valarr and Matarys.[18][12] As such, Daeron II was succeeded by his second son, Aerys I Targaryen, in 209 AC, whose reign began with a two-year drought.[12] The Spring Sickness had hit the cities of the Seven Kingdoms most, especially King's Landing, and most of the hostages King Daeron II had once taken after the First Blackfyre Rebellion had died, leaving their relatives feeling secure enough about attempting a new rebellion.[10] Lord Gormon Peake convinced Daemon II Blackfyre to cross the narrow sea to claim the throne.[52] However, the Second Blackfyre Rebellion was far less successful than the first, as Daemon II was arrested at Whitewalls before he could even gather an army.[10] He was kept alive as a hostage at King's Landing, but died within years, allowing Aegor Rivers to crown Haegon I Blackfyre the new Blackfyre pretender. Haegon attempted his invasion in 219 AC, when he crossed the narrow sea with the Golden Company, led by Aegor Rivers. Haegon was slain after he had surrendered his sword, while Aegor was arrested, and sentenced to join the Night's Watch. He managed to escape, and returned to Tyrosh, where he crowned Haegon's son, Daemon III Blackfyre.[52]"

Though he had been married to Lady Aelinor Penrose before his reign began, his marriage remained unconsummated. He additionally refused to take another to wife. As he had no issue of his own, he firstly acknowledged his younger brother Rhaegel as his heir. Following Rhaegel's death in 215 AC, Rhaegel's son Aelor was named Prince of Dragonstone.

Maekar I's eldest son, Prince Daeron, had predeceased his father, and left behind only one child: a simple-minded daughter, Vaella. Maekar's second son, Aerion, had died in 232 AC when drinking a cup of wildfire. Aerion's only issue was an infant son named Maegor, born the same year Aerion had died. Maekar's third son, Aemon, had been sent to the Citadel at Oldtown by King Daeron II at a young age,[55] where he had completed his maester's chain at the age of nineteen,[56] and his youngest son, Aegon (also known as \"Egg\"), was disliked by several lords, as he had often meddled in their affairs.[19][55]",

Concerned for the welfare of the poor and weak, Aegon V made attempts to increase the flow of food to the north. However, some disagreed, as they felt Aegon did too much in this regard.[33] Aegon further wanted to diminish the powers of the lords, and enacted numerous reforms while giving new rights and protections to the smallfolk. For this, he faced fierce opposition and at times even open defiance. One lord even went as far as to denounce Aegon V as a \"bloody-handed tyrant intent on depriving us of our gods-given rights and liberties.\"[33]",

When Duncan, in 239 AC, broke his betrothal to a daughter of Lord Lyonel Baratheon to marry Jenny of Oldstones, going as far as to renounce his rights to the throne for her, Lord Lyonel declared the independence of the Stormlands in response. Only after his defeat in a trial by combat against the Lord Commander of Aegon's Kingsguard, Ser Duncan the Tall, and the promise of the hand of Aegon V's daughter Rhaelle in marriage to Lyonel's heir, Ormund Baratheon, did Lyonel join the King's peace again.[33] Aegon's other children (except Rhaelle) all broke their own betrothals as well.

However, in a great tragedy occurred, causing the death of Aegon V, Prince Duncan, and many more. Though the survivors would not speak of what had happened, the histories of Archmaester Gyldayn, note that the last maester to serve at the castle, spoke of seven eggs and pyromancers.[33] As Summerhall was burning down, Princess Rhaella Targaryen, the only daughter of Prince Jaehaerys and Princess Shaera, gave birth to a healthy son named Rhaegar.[22]"

                    "While the reign of King Aerys II Targaryen began with much promise, his would become the reign which ended the Targaryen Dynasty. Upon ascending the throne, he replaced all of his father's elderly councilors with younger men, and appointed a friend from his youth, the twenty-year old Tywin Lannister, as his Hand of the King. While Aerys had great plans for his realm, his attention span was short and most plans were quickly forgotten. While Tywin would be Aerys II's Hand for nineteen years, tensions between the two friends began early in Aerys's reign. Aerys grew increasingly jealous of Tywin and over time began to insult him, while the deaths of several of his children contributed further to his madness. When in 276 AC, after three miscarriages, two stillbirths, and three deaths in the cradle, Prince Viserys was born, Tywin hosted a tournament in honor of Viserys's birth at Lannisport, which Aerys II and Rhaegar attended.[30] There, Tywin suggested his ten-year-old daughter Cersei as a bride for Rhaegar, and her twin Jaime as Rhaegar's squire.[30][62] Aerys refused him, stating he would not wed his son to the daughter of his servant.[62]",
                    "Aerys's jealousy for Tywin increased further when he learned of the saying that Tywin was the true ruler of the kingdom, making his suspicious of his subjects at court. His jealousy and desire to show himself as a leader led to his rash action of accepting the invitation of Lord Darklyn to travel to Duskendale, as to discuss Darklyn's petition. Aerys went to Duskendale with only a small escort, and was captured upon arrival. This revolt, known as the Defiance of Duskendale, lasted for half a year, during which time Aerys II was kept in the dungeons, while Lord Tywin besieged the city. Though he was eventually freed, the last of Aerys's sanity had died during his captivity. He became increasingly suspicious everyone, including his own heir, Rhaegar, and refused to leave the Red Keep for four years. Tensions between Aerys and Rhaegar grew, more so after Rhaegar and his new bride Elia Martell moved to his seat of Dragonstone in 280 AC. In 281 AC, Aerys appointed Tywin's heir, Ser Jaime Lannister, to his Kingsguard, leaving Tywin with a dwarf for an heir. Tywin resigned as Hand and left King's Landing. Convinced that his son Rhaegar planned to gather as much lords as possible to dispose Aerys at the Tourney of Harrenhal held later that same year, Aerys personally attended the tourney. When the victorious Prince Rhaegar passed by his own wife, Elia, and named Lyanna Stark, the betrothed of his cousin Robert Baratheon, as his queen of love and beauty, it caused fury and tensions among those present, and inflamed Aerys's council against Rhaegar further.[63]",

Lyanna's brother Brandon went to King's Landing, threatening Prince Rhaegar's life. Though Rhaegar was not present, King Aerys had Brandon arrested, and summoned his father, Lord Rickard, for a trial. At the \"trial\", Aerys had both men killed, after which he demanded the heads of Lord Robert Baratheon, Lyanna's betrothed, and Eddard Stark, Lyanna's younger brother. Their foster father, Lord Jon Arryn, refused Aerys's commands and raised his banners, thereby starting a civil war.[64]",

Feigning loyalty to House Targaryen, the Lannister forces sacked King's Landing once allowed into the city,[69][67] slaying Princess Elia, Rhaenys, and the infant Prince Aegon,[70][71] while Aerys's only Kingsguard knight in the city, Jaime Lannister, killed the king in the throne room.[68][67]",

Twenty-three knights of Maegor's household fought in the blood-soaked streets of Lord Harroway's Town for the prize. Ser Walton Towers, though gravely wounded, was the victor. He was named Lord of Harrenhal, though he died within a fortnight from the wounds he had taken in the battle.[1]",

When the realm began to turn against Maegor for Prince Jaehaerys, Lord Towers was among the lords who gathered at the king's command. Lords Towers and Rosby were the last to see Maegor alive before he mysteriously died upon the Iron Throne.[1] Lord Jordan yielded the Red Keep to Jaehaerys and was pardoned for his loyalty to Maegor, though he had to surrender lands.[5]",

Lord Maegor lived at Harrenhal for a few years with Jaehaery's widowed sister, Rhaena Targaryen, who then cared for Maegor's household after the Lord of Harrenhal passed away in 61 AC.[2]",

Hoster forbade Petyr from marrying either of his daughters due to his low standing, and ordered Lysa to drink moon tea to prevent her from bearing Petyr's child.[21] Hoster accepted an offer from Lord Tywin Lannister to wed Ser Jaime Lannister to Lysa, but Jaime unexpectedly joined the Kingsguard before this could occur.[22] Hoster rebuffed Tywin's offer of his dwarf younger son, Tyrion, as a replacement.[23] Other prospects existed from House Brax and others, but Hoster finally accepted an offer from Lord Rickard Stark that Catelyn be betrothed to Brandon Stark, heir to Winterfell.

The riverlands was a major theater in Robert's Rebellion, and Lord Hoster fought in the Battle of the Bells.[25] His control over his bannermen was not complete, however, as the Darrys, Mootons, and Rygers supported the Targaryens.[26] Hoster also crushed the royalist Goodbrooks.[27] House Frey delayed their contribution until after the decisive Battle of the Trident, itself fought in the riverlands.

Ser Loras asks permission to take command of the siege of Dragonstone from Lord Redwyne, so the Redwyne fleet is no longer needed at the island and can return to the Reach to face the ironborn.[48] Although Loras is successful in taking Dragonstone, he is severely injured.[46]",

When Septa Moelle reports at court that Margaery's maidenhead has been broken, Grand Maester Pycelle reveals how he provided Margaery with moon tea on several occasions (as per Cersei's instructions). While she is confined by the Faith, Margaery is visited by Cersei and scolds her for framing her. A mob forms in front of the Great Sept, calling out Margaery's name.[51]",

In 10 AC Ser Corlys Velaryon became the first Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.[13] His elder brother, Lord Aethan Velaryon became master of ships for Aegon I.[14] Lord Aethan thus succeeded his father as the Admiral of the Royal Fleet, and in turn was succeeded by his own son Lord Daemon Velaryon.[8] Lord Aethan fought against Sargoso Saan, a pirate-lord, in the Stepstones.[15][8]",
                            "Aethan's daughter, Alyssa, was married to Prince Aenys Targaryen, heir to the throne, in 22 AC, with whom she had six children (Rhaena, Aegon, Viserys, Jaehaerys, Alysanne, and Vaella).[14] Alyssa became queen at her husband's coronation. She outlived Aenys I and became a prisoner of his brother, Maegor I Targaryen, on Dragonstone, when Maegor claimed the throne over Aenys's sons by Alyssa. In 44 AC Alyssa fled in the confusion that followed the death of Dowager Queen Visenya Targaryen. Her last surviving son by Aenys, Jaehaerys, put forward his claim for the throne. Lord Daemon Velaryon, Maegor's admiral of the fleet, who had previously supported Maegor, turned against the cruel king, and many of the great houses of Westeros joined with him.[16]",
                            "Alyssa's son Jaehaerys became king at the age of fourteen, and Alyssa ruled as his regent, aided by Lord Rogar Baratheon.[1] After Jaehaerys reached the age of majority, the regency ended, and Alyssa married Rogar,[17] giving birth to two more children: Boremund and Jocelyn Baratheon.[18] The Velaryons of the Old King's reign were a house even more influential than House Lannister.[19]"

Corlys became the first man from Westeros to sail to Yi Ti, returning rich with spices, silks, and other treasures. He accumulated so much wealth that House Velaryon became the richest house in the realm, and himself the wealthiest man in the Seven Kingdoms, waxing even greater than the Lannisters or Hightowers. Because their ancestral castle, Driftmark, was damp and crowded, Corlys constructed a new seat for the Velaryons, High Tide.[1]",
                            "Alyssa's daughter Jocelyn was eventually wed to Alyssa's grandson, Prince Aemon Targaryen, at the time the heir to the throne. Their child, Princess Rhaenys, was in turn wed to Lord Corlys, and gave birth to two children by him: Laena and Laenor, both of whom became dragonriders. During the Great Council of 101 AC, Laenor's claim to the throne was presented before the lords of the Seven Kingdoms. Although primogeniture favored him, and his father's wealth, fame and reputation resulted in much support for Laenor, in the end he lost to Prince Viserys Targaryen,[1] causing a rift between the Velaryons and the Iron Throne.[10] After Queen Aemma Arryn died, King Viserys I's Grand Maester, Runciter, suggested Corlys's twelve-year-old daughter Laena as a new bride, but House Velaryon was passed over once more. In response, Corlys and his family shunned Viserys's wedding to Alicent Hightower.[10][11]",
                            "Corlys eventually befriended Prince Daemon Targaryen, with whom he invaded the Stepstones in 106 AC. When Daemon's wife, Rhea Royce, died in 115 AC, Corlys happily agreed to wed Laena to Daemon, following the death of Laena's betrothed. Laena's brother, Laenor, had married Rhaenyra Targaryen, the Princess of Dragonstone, the year before. Although that marriage resulted in three sons, it was rumored that all three boys were bastards of Ser Harwin Strong, as they looked nothing like Rhaenyra and Laenor.[10][11] Laena gave birth to twin girls for Daemon, but died in childbirth several years later, in early 120 AC. Laenor was killed shortly after by Ser Qarl Correy.[10][11]"

Prince Jacaerys Velaryon flew to Winterfell and negotiated the Pact of Ice and Fire.[20] Prince Lucerys Velaryon traveled as an envoy to Storm's End, where he was killed by Prince Aemond Targaryen,[21] and Corlys grew furious with Rhaenyra when Rhaenys died at Rook's Rest. Lord Velaryon was brought back into the fold by Rhaenyra naming him Hand of the Queen.[21]",
                            "When Prince Jacaerys offered the people of Dragonstone to attempt and claim a dragon, to increase the number of dragonriders, Addam of Hull and his brother Alyn made their attempt. Addam succeeded in claiming the dragon Seasmoke, who had previously been ridden by Ser Laenor Velaryon. According to their mother, Marilda, Laenor had fathered the two boys, which many found a dubious claim, as Laenor had preferred men. The court fool Mushroom suggests that Addam and Alyn had actually been fathered by Corlys, who had kept them far away from his fiery-tempered wife. With his wife now dead, and the paternity of his son Laenor's children in question, Corlys agreed to adopt both boys into House Velaryon, petitioning Rhaenyra to remove the taint of bastardy from them, enabling him to name them his heirs.[21]",

                            "When Rhaenyra became paranoid following the betrayal of the new dragonriders later on in the war, she ordered Addam's arrest. Corlys objected, and when ignored, warned Addam, allowing him to flee King's Landing. Addam later fought at the Second Battle of Tumbleton, proving his loyalty to Rhaenyra by defeating her foes at the cost of his own life. Meanwhile, Corlys was thrown in the dungeon, and so the Velaryon fleet abandoned Rhaenyra's cause.[21] Prince Joffrey Velaryon fell to his death during the Storming of the Dragonpit.[21] Rhaenyra fled the capital, but was fed to Sunfyre after the fall of Dragonstone.[21]",
                            "Corlys was freed when Aegon II took King's Landing after the Moon of the Three Kings.[22] In exchange for a pardon,[22] Corlys used his wealth and power to support Aegon II. However, he refused to accept the execution of Rhaenyra's surviving son, Prince Aegon the Younger, and insisted the boy should be betrothed to Aegon II's only remaining child, Princess Jaehaera, as a requirement for his support.[23] Corlys served on Aegon II's small council until the king's death.[22] Corlys acted quickly by sending envoys to Aegon II's main supporters, but was arrested on the charge of poisoning Aegon II by Lord Cregan Stark. He was freed by his granddaughters and Lady Alysanne Blackwood, however, and served the new king as a regent until his death in 132 AC.[24]"

Gawen is freed from Seagard after his daughter marries the King in the North, although they wed without his consent. Rollam Westerling becomes Robb's squire and Ser Raynald Westerling joins his retinue. When House Westerling joins House Stark in the War of the Five Kings, they bring fifty men, of whom only twelve are knights.[5] Sybell provides a posset to Jeyne, claiming it will make her fertile.[20]",

Gared kills two of their murderers in retribution, but the third, Britt Warrick, escapes and brings word of Gared's defiance to Ludd Whitehill, Lord of Highpoint. Gared's sister is has died before he arrives, and his father dies soon after from his wounds.",

Gared soon begins to train among the other new recruits, including Finn and Cotter.

Both combatants are admonished and punished by Frostfinger, but Jon Snow takes Gared to the top of the Wall to further ask him about his origins and intentions.[2]"

                    "For some years after the Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons, the Rogare Bank rivaled the Iron Bank of Braavos in size[4] and the family became heavily involved in Westerosi court intrigues during the Lyseni Spring.[5] Although the Rogares at the Red Keep were apparently guilty of some crimes, their rivals in King's Landing blamed them for many more. Lord Thaddeus Rowan was tortured in an attempt to find evidence against the Rogares, and Ser Marston Waters, the Hand of the King to Aegon III Targaryen, sent men to capture Larra after arresting her brothers. Aegon and Viserys refused to surrender Larra, however, and the case against the Rogares collapsed.[4] Larra left the court at King's Landing after she grew homesick[6] and returned to Lys in 139 AC.[7]",

Rival magisters resented Lysandro's heir, the ambitious Lysaro Rogare, who was scourged to death at the Temple of Trade. Lysaro's siblings were not executed, however, and Moredo Rogare, carrier of the Valyrian steel longsword Truth, once led a campaign against Lys.[3]It is implied that Moredo was at least somewhat successful in his campaign against Lys, because he was able to put the bones of his dead brother that had been left chained to a pillar at the Temple of Trade into the family crypt 138 AC three years after he was scourged.[1]"
